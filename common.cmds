#
#   runcmds.sh
#       -e RELEASE_VERSION <release version> \
#       -e NEXT_DEVELOPMENT_VERSION <next development version> \
#       -e RUNCMDS_PATH <runcmds command path> \
#       -s ./common.cmds
#
#   Where:
#       - <release version> is the needed release version
#       - <next development version> is the next needed development version
#       - <runcmds command path> is the path to the runcmds command line (usually <runcmds root>/runcmds.sh)
