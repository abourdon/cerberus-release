# Cerberus release processes

[Cerberus](http://www.cerberus-testing.org/) is an user-friendly automated testing framework.

This project is the entry point to release Cerberus project modules.

## Get started

This project defines a set of release processes, each of them represented by a `.cmds` file.

A `.cmds` file gathers all necessary commands to be executed in order to apply a release process. These commands can be executed thanks to the [runcmds](https://github.com/abourdon/runcmds) command execution tool.
 
Finally, each `.cmds` file contains a documentation header part to describe how to use it.

## List of available release processes

Hereafter the list of available release processes:
